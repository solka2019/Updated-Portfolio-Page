# Password Generator - Homework 03

# Purpose and functionality of the application
In this app, the user will choose a password with a determined number of characteres and the app will generate a random password. 

If no button is clicked, then the application won't create the password and will repeat the alert asking for the lenght of the password.

 The user has to make at least one choice for the application to generate a random password. If the user chooses all of the options (Upper case letters, Lower case letters, Numeric, Special characteres), then the password will show with a mix of all of them in the length that was designated by the user. 

After having the password generated, the user can "copy to clipboard."
